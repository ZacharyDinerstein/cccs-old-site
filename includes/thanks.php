            How the Process Works</h1>
        <ol class="simple-list">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Complete your Free Debt Analysis and discuss your
                financial situation</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                Your credit counselor will work with you to assess your debt, review your budget,
                and determine what debt relief options are available to you.
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Estimate your monthly payment with a debt management
                program</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                At the end of your Debt Analysis if you qualify for a debt management program, your
                counselor will provide the real dollar amount you would pay each month if you enroll.
                You can enroll right then or take time think about it&mdash;no limited-time offers!<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start the program and pay just one payment each
                month</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                You pay us one monthly payment and we negotiate and pay your creditors on your behalf.
                You can tell any creditors or collection agencies who call that you are enrolled
                in our program.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be debt-free faster than you think</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are behind in your payments, most creditors will agree to bring your accounts
                current after about 3 payments. Most clients are completely debt-free in 36-60 payments&mdash;thatâ€™s
                3-5 years to eliminate ALL your credit card debt, not 10-20!<br>
                <br>
            </li>
        </ol>
