                <p>Consolidated Credit helped me pay off a lot of my credit card debt in a considerable short period of time. I was very happy with how professional and knowledgeable all of the representatives were when I had an issue or question. I am in a much better place financially now than four years ago when I joined the program. Thank you Consolidated Credit for helping me get my debt under control.</p>';
