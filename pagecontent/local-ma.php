                <p>I have been with CCCS for many years. It was the best decision I ever made and I will finally be paying off these credit cards in the next few months. I am ecstatic. I would recommend this company for paying off your credit to anyone that needs help. Customer service is great and a pleasure to work with.</p>';

                <p>I never thought I would see the day where I have made 1 year straight of on time payments to my credit cards. I haven\'t missed a month yet and it\'s all because Consolidated Credit brought my rates down and lowered my monthly payment!</p>';
