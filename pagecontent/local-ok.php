                <p>We struggled with debt for quite some time and realized there was just no way we could get out of the mess we\'d made without help. My call to Consolidated Credit was a last-ditch effort to figure out a solution. Thankfully, they were able to structure the repayment plan that we currently have to help us make headway on getting rid of this debt. We still have three years to go on our plan, but I look forward to the day when we are debt-free and out from under the stress that debt causes. I have enjoyed talking with CC employees. They have always been kind and helpful.</p>';
